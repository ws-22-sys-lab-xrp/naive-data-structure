Demo try with naive data structure

Trying to create some navie data structures to show potential of using xrp.

----

Potential Targets:

1. Modification with BPF-KV
2. EasyList
3. SkipList

Current Problems:

1. Not fully understand disk-io process in the code implementation

Current Workflow:

1. Try to imitate the xrp implementation step-by-step
